This app displays list of shelters for Hurricane Irma. This project is a fork of a similar project mapping shelters for Hurricane Harvey, a project which mapped Houston shelters [from a Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14GHRHQ_7cqVrj0B7HCTVE5EbfpNFMbSI9Gi8azQyn-k). 

Created using React and Leaflet map.

Thanks to everyone working to keep this sheet constantly updated.
